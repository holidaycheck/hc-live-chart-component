# ideas
- [ ] syntax highlighting in JS editor
- [ ] make labels ONLY on the side of the axis shorter, but when hovering it should be completely visible
- [ ] verify the data returned by the JS code to fit for rendering, and give hints if it doesn't
- [ ] make chart useable on mobile devices

# version 1
- [x] show errors in JS
- [x] make the labels easier to read when they are long - shortened labels to 30chars
- [x] build + deploy via travis
- [ ] show only the first line of the error message
