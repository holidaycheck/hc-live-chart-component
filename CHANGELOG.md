# ideas
- [ ] syntax highlighting in JS editor
- [ ] make labels ONLY on the side of the axis shorter, but when hovering it should be completely visible
- [ ] verify the data returned by the JS code to fit for rendering, and give hints if it doesn't
- [ ] make chart useable on mobile devices
- [ ] store previous data in localstorage and show them using another dataset, in the same chart, so be able to compare
- [ ] allow an attribute "unit" which may take values like "seconds", "bytes", etc. and each knows how to scale them 
      e.g. "minutes", "hours", "kB" or "MB", etc.

# version 1
- [x] show errors in JS
- [x] make the labels easier to read when they are long - shortened labels to 30chars
- [x] build + deploy via travis
- [ ] show only the first line of the error message
